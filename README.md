## About buildingSMART International

**buildingSMART International (bSI)** is a non-profit organization leading the global development and adoption of digital open standards in the construction and infrastructure industries. Our mission is to improve the built environment through collaborative digital practices, promoting interoperability, and encouraging efficient and transparent data exchange across the entire lifecycle of buildings and infrastructure.

Our core focus areas include:

- **Developing Standards**: We drive openBIM standards like the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and the Information Delivery Specifications (IDS), ensuring they are freely available for anyone to use and implement.
- **Fostering Collaboration**: We provide a global platform where individuals, companies, and organizations collaborate to solve industry challenges.
- **Promoting Education**: We empower industry professionals and stakeholders through resources, training, and certifications to adopt and implement openBIM effectively.
